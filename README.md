Submitted by: **NING YANG**

Time spent: **40** hours spent in total

## Description

- Quantium has had a data partnership with a large supermarket brand for the last few years who provide transactional and customer data. I partipated as an analyst within the Quantium analytics team and am responsible for delivering highly valued data analytics and insights to help the business make strategic decisions. 
- Supermarkets will regularly change their store layouts, product selections, prices and promotions. This is to satisfy their customer’s changing needs and preferences, keep up with the increasing competition in the market or to capitalise on new opportunities. The Quantium analytics team are engaged in these processes to evaluate and analyse the performance of change and recommend whether it has been successful. 

### Task1-Data preparation and customer analytics:
- Examine transaction data and customer data – look for inconsistencies, missing data across the data set, outliers, correctly identified category items, numeric data across all tables. 

- Data analysis and customer segments – define the metrics – look at total sales, drivers of sales, where the highest sales are coming from. Explore the data, create charts and graphs as well as noting any interesting trends and insights. 

- Deep dive into customer segments – give recommendation from my insights, determine which segments we should be targeting, if packet sizes are relative and form an overall conclusion based on your analysis. 

### Task2 - Experimentation and uplift testing:
- Evaluate the performance of a store trial which was performed in stores 77, 86 and 88.

- Create a measure to compare different control stores to each of the trial stores to do this write a function to reduce having to re-do the analysis for each trial store. Consider using Pearson correlations and a metric such as a magnitude distance

- Select control stores, compare each trial and control pair during the trial period. Test if total sales are significantly different in the trial period and if so, check if the driver of change is more purchasing customers or more purchases per customers etc.


### Task3 - Analytics and commercial application
- Send a report to manager, based on analytics from the previous tasks and provide her with insights and recommendations that she can use when developing the strategic plan for the next half year.
